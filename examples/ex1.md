Somewhat hard to make it take off, but once it starts growing, it will not die. Tends to grow outwards with yellos cells, using green cells as anchors to stay alive. Tends to not fully stabilize, preffering alterating or constantly changing patterns, even in forever alive areas.

## Shape: Flower (Ryan Makela)

Grows with diagonal and cardinal symmetry until move ~180, when it stabilizes with a few alterating parts.

## Shape: Space Invader (Ivan Gavrushenko)
```

```

Grows with vertical and horizontal symmetries. Doesn't stabilize (?).

## Shape: Skewed Space Invader (Ivan Gavrushenko)
```

Grows asymmetrically, favoring bottom left (off of how it's shown here). Doesn't stabilize.

## Shape: Monocle (Ivan Gavrushenko)
